Trivial command-line tool build in educational purposes & for personal use.<br>
Allows to easily find unused resources in XCode project.

## How it works
1. A script looks for images. For now it supports 4 types: *.pdf, .png, .img, .jpg*; 
2. It finds image-containable file. There are 4 types as well: *.swift, .m, .xib, .storyboard*;
3. Then it loops through images and files, checking if a file contains an image. The checking depends on the file type:
    - If it's `.swift` file, the script searches `UIImage(named: "imageName")` occurences;
    - If it's `.m` file, the script searches `[UIImage imageNamed: @"imageName"]` occurences;
    - If it's `.xib`/`.storyboard` file, the script searches `image="imageName"` occurences;
4.  If the script could find unused image in these files, it prints them in a good-looking way:
